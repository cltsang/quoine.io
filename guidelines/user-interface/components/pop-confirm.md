Breadcrumbs help users visualize their current location in relation to the rest of the website or application by showing the hierarchy of pages. Breadcrumbs are easily understood by users, take up very little space on the page, and facilitate discovery. When breadcrumbs are present on a page, they should never replace the main navigation.

The entities in breadcrumbs show the hierarchical progress from the highest level to the lowest, one step at a time. This typically starts with the homepage all the way down to the current page or content.

## Breadcrumbs

Entity name: An entity represents a section or page within the product or page. Entity names use a button link that uses the section or page title to link to that section or page.

Separator: Provides a visual distinction between individual entities.
Best practices

### Do

In product, avoid using the topmost level of the hierarchy (typically the container name).
Use when the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source like when another page deep links to the page in question.
Use for large websites and products that have hierarchically arranged pages.

### Don't

Don't use breadcrumbs for single-level websites that don't have a logical hierarchy or grouping.

## Specifications

Breadcrumbs should be placed at the top left corner of the screen, above the page title.
